# PyBV
A Python Implementation of the BV Homomorphic Encryption Scheme

The scheme was proposed by Lauter et al. in - Can Homomorphic Encryption be Practical? (https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/405.pdf) which was a variant of the Some-what homomorphic encryption scheme given by Brakerski et al. in - Fully Homomorphic Encryption from Ring-LWE and Security for Key Dependent Messages (http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~zvikab/localpapers/IdealHom.pdf).
